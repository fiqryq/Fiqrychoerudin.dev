<p>At the beginning of the year, I tried something new which was learning the ReactJS framework. Why did I choose React? I had a dream of working at a unicorn company in Indonesia and when I participated in a mini bootcamp at the end of 2021, my mentor <a href="https://twitter.com/azharieazharou">Muhammad Azharie</a>, who was working at one of Indonesia&#x27;s unicorn companies which is Tokopedia, he told me that Tokopedia used the ReactJs framework for frontend, At that moment, I thought that the first step for me to be able to work at a big company like Tokopedia was to learn React. I started learning React at the beginning of 2022 and it turned out to be a huge step for my career.</p>
