2022 was a very meaningful year for me because some of my dreams were achieved in 2022 and it was also a very difficult year for me. I will write about it in this writing as a reminder for myself and a personal record for the following year.

### Starting Learn React ecosystem

At the beginning of the year, I tried something new which was learning the ReactJS framework. Why did I choose React? I had a dream of working at a unicorn company in Indonesia and when I participated in a mini bootcamp at the end of 2021, my mentor [Muhammad Azharie](https://twitter.com/azharieazharou), who was working at one of Indonesia's unicorn companies which is Tokopedia, he told me that Tokopedia used the ReactJs framework for frontend, At that moment, I thought that the first step for me to be able to work at a big company like Tokopedia was to learn React. I started learning React at the beginning of 2022 and it turned out to be a huge step for my career.

### I got my first freelance job from learning ReactJS.
